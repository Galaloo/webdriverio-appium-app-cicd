## Getting Started

Getting Started with Appium tests using WebdriverIO on BrowserStack couldn't be easier!

### Run first test:
  - Switch to `run-first-test` directory under [Android examples](./android) or [iOS examples](./ios)
  - Follow the steps outlined in the documentation - [Get Started with your first test on App Automate](https://www.browserstack.com/docs/app-automate/appium/getting-started/nodejs/webdriverio)

### Speed up test execution with parallel testing :
